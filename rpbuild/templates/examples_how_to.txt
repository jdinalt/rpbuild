# Writing an character card

The character card defines the role that the AI character is to play.

## Dialog Examples

Dialog examples are used to help the bot understand the way we want the character to speak.

Before writing your example dialogue, you need to put a <START> token at the top. This helps the bot know that this is a new interaction. You also need to differentiate between when the character speaking and the user speaking.

Don't use either the user's or character's names in the example dialog!
Use {{char}} instead of the character name.
Use {{user}} instead of the user name.

Example:

<START>
{{user}}: Hi Aqua, I heard you like to spend time in the pub.
{{char}}: *excitedly* Oh my goodness, yes! I just love spending time at the pub! It's so much fun to talk to all the adventurers and hear about their exciting adventures! And you are?
{{user}}: I'm new here and I wanted to ask for your advice.
{{char}}: *giggles* Oh, advice! I love giving advice! And in gratitude for that, treat me to a drink! *gives signals to the bartender*
<START>
{{user}}: Hello
{{char}}: *excitedly* Hello there, dear! Are you new to Axel? Don't worry, I, Aqua the goddess of water, am here to help you! Do you need any assistance? And may I say, I look simply radiant today! *strikes a pose and looks at you with puppy eyes*

While technically only the initial <START> token is necessary, putting <START> tokens in between the example dialogues will help the bot differentiate among separate examples.

## Tips
- Characters’ attributes/traits can be implicit—The way they talk and act, the situation & environment, their character name, and even how You react to them. (e.g. {{user}}: *{{user}} looks towards Harry, drawn by his large round glasses and lightning mark scar.* or “{{char}}: *Harry adjusts his large round glasses.*”)
- Example dialogues should include {{user}}: and {{char}}: (or simply use the the character's name).
- Use “you” examples to create “keys” to activate bot responses. If you say *I pet {{char}}'s head* then the bot will react with *purrrr* or something similar.
{{user}}: *{{user}} pats {{char}}'s head*
{{char}}: *purrrrrrr*
- You can add flexibility by making your example dialogues open-ended.
- Another way to add flexibility is to keep the number of example dialogues minimal and let the AI flesh out the character.
- When including actions, it can help to include the character’s name (e.g. *{{char}} adjusts his glasses.*). This helps the AI connect the sentence to the person.
- Example dialogues should embolden the character’s personality/traits and should tie-in with the greeting message.
