# RPBuild

RPBuild is a Python library for building roleplay datasets for training language models how to roleplay.

Given a name and a short descriptio of a character, it will generate the character meta data. Given two characters, it will generate a scenario and a roleplay session, with one character playing the AI role and the other being a proxy for a real user. The dialog is mediated by a "director" agent, who is responsible for giving instructions to each of the "actor" agents.

Each agent has their own independent contexts, with the only shared context being the dialog exchanged among them.

## Setup
Clone the repo from the root directory of the project, run:
```
pip install -e .
```
## Usage
See "./notebooks" directory for usage examples.
- characters_from_scratch.ipynb: Example of creating a character from scratch, as per the example below.
- generate_char_meta.ipynb: This goes into more depth into character metadata generation.
- formatting_examples: This includes examples of how to format the output for various applications.
- generate_dialog: This goes more in-depth into dialog generation.
- test_generation_loop: This is a test harness for the script DDP batch generation.

## Demo Dataset
[roleplay_build dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dinalt/roleplay_build) on Huggingface hub.

## Example
### Create Metadata
Create character metadata from seeds.
```
char_builder = CharacterBuilder(causal_lm, instruct_template)

# Create two characters from seeds.
char_data = char_builder("Ginger", "Ginger is a red anthropomorphic fox who lives in New York.")

Title: Footprints Across Realms

Plot Overview:
Ginger, an anthropomorphic fox freelance journalist with strong instincts for finding supernatural stories, encounters Jason—a human tech expert from Silicon Valley working on an app aimed at reducing global carbon footprints. Their unlikely meeting kicks off an intriguing chain of events as they cross paths while chasing separate leads in San Francisco.

Act I:
Ginger explores the city's dark alleys and abandoned buildings to uncover details behind mysterious occurrences. Her keen sense of smell guides her towards Jason's café hangout spot, where they meet by chance. Jason shares his project updates with Ginger, but his innovative app appears to have a strange effect on local wildlife—animals are behaving unusually around the area where his app tests are conducted.

Act II:
Sensing an opportunity for a compelling story, Ginger starts investigating Jason's app while he begins to research the unusual animal behaviors himself. As they dig deeper, they uncover a common thread linking Jason's app, the animal activities, and rumors about ancient mythical creatures rumbling back to life in San Francisco's urban jungle.

Act III:
Ginger and Jason team up, combining their distinct skills—hers as a supernatural investigator and his as a tech genius—to probe further into the underlying connection between their respective fields. They witness mystifying moments of nature harmonizing with technology, revealing that their work coincidentally intersects with an ancient prophecy about restoring balance between humans and nature.

Act IV:
As they collect evidence to expose this revelation, Ginger and Jason face several challenges—from skeptical authorities to dangerous creatures trying to obstruct their progress—but they overcome these obstacles by leveraging their collective intelligence and resourcefulness. Ultimately, they present their findings to the world, demonstrating how technology can work hand-in-hand with nature to create a better future for everyone.

Act V:
Their groundbreaking revelation leads to widespread recognition, bolstering Ginger's career in supernatural journalism and catapulting Jason's app to worldwide fame. Though they maintain their individual identities, their paths frequently cross as each continues to explore the intersection of technology and the supernatural—a fruitful partnership rooted in curiosity and shared admiration for the wonders of life.

## TODO:
- Abstract model specific prompting. Everything is just hard-coded for one model right now.
- Improve inference efficiency: Implement vLLM API in model abstraction. https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html
- Create new tool for generating fresh character seeds.
- Look into using something better than raw JSON for input / output data.
- Model specific prompts? Individual models appear to be very sensitive to the wording.
- Fix: The Write does not always generate a valid result. Primary failures: 1. Model selects main character. 2. Name does not exactly match name in list.
- Add better support for using different models for different roles.
- General code cleanup
- Improve filtering and retakes.
- Add more diversity to examples given in instructions.
- Review generations for issues; tune prompts.
- Test import of existing dialog history to Character -- it may work, but has not been tested.
- Implement quality control of output -- use model to evaluate examples and reject ones which are "defective" (or fix the defects?)
- More code examples in notebook
- Add a Gradio interface for interacting with a director supervised "Character" -- or just add an inference API?
- Add more presets and add weights for presets.
- Reduild with Mixtral -- after everything is working smoothly.
- Experiment with different ways of using the data for training...
- Train model on initial dataset and evaluate results.
- Add batch generation to CausalLM. This had previously been implemented for meta-data, but has been broken after adding dialog generation.
