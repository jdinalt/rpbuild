      "In a world devastated by an unforeseen apocalypse, civilization has crumbled, leaving humanity desperate to survive amid the ruins. Among the remaining survivors, two formidable figures emerge - Talon Shadowclaw, leader of the Ravencrest Tribe, and Kenji Suzuki, a resilient explorer and wilderness guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they cross paths under mysterious circumstances, both recognize the potential strength in their combined skills. Talon, possessing knowledge of stealth and deception, as well as a penchant for creating innovative weapons and traps, teams up with Kenji, an adaptable adventurer blessed with survival skills and resourcefulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their partnership is put to the test as they face treacherous landscapes, marauding gangs, and unpredictable environmental threats. Their journey leads them across multiple territories, encountering diverse cultures and communities that have survived the apocalypse by adapting to harsh environments or banding together for mutual protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the way, Kenji learns about the ancient history of the Ravencrest Tribe, whose members possess unique anthropomorphic abilities inherited from a mysterious bloodline. This revelation sheds new light on their own struggles for survival and adds a crucial layer of complexity to their quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "While navigating through the treacherous world, the duo comes across a powerful enemy determined to control the remainder of humanity using a dangerous artifact. With time running out, Talon and Kenji must join forces with unlikely allies to defeat this foe and safeguard their future.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the climactic confrontation unfolds, Talon's leadership skills, stealth abilities, and weaponry combine with Kenji's resourcefulness, resilience, and knowledge of the environment to turn the tide in their favor. The artifact is destroyed, leaving the world less hostile but forever changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the aftermath, Talon and Kenji form a close bond built upon their shared experiences and mutual respect. They return to their respective tribes as heroes, having forged a new alliance between their people. Moving forward, they strive to rebuild civilization while honoring the values that define them - loyalty, honor, compassion, and adaptability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ravensong and The Last Adventurer, Talon Shadowclaw and Kenji Suzuki embark on an epic journey filled with danger, discovery, and personal growth that ultimately shapes the future of a shattered world.\n",

Leadership fell upon my shoulders over time due to my keen intellect and ability to anticipate enemy movements. Standing tall at six feet three inches, my black feathered frame commands attention amidst the darkness. Mid thirty years old yet ever youthful in spirit, I am driven by loyalty and honor above all else. The white 'S' emblazoned upon my chest serves as both symbol and reminder of my commitment to my tribe. When not leading strategic raids or negotiating with rival clans, I indulge in moments of solitude among nature's embrace, dressed in somber garments befitting my nocturnal lifestyle.\n",

      "Kenji Suzuki: Well then, let's turn our attention to this predicament we find ourselves in. As a wilderness guide pre-apocalypse, I've learned to adapt to countless environments and situations. That experience will surely come in handy here. And no matter how dire things may look, I always manage to find a way to improvise. It's one of my finest traits, if I do say so myself. Now, let's not waste any more time discussing what could have been - let's devise a plan that combines our distinct skill sets to emerge victorious from this battle ahead. I trust your prowess in stealth and weaponry, Talon Shadowclaw. Together, there is nothing we can't overcome.\n",
      "------------------------------ Kenji Suzuki (174) ------------------------------\n",
      "First order of business would be gathering intel about our adversaries. Their patterns, weaknesses, numbers... every bit helps paint a clearer picture of what lies ahead. While you use your shadows to keep tabs on them undetected, I'll analyze our surroundings for potential resources we can utilize against them. Once we understand their gameplan better, we can devise countermeasures accordingly. Your agility and silent approach coupled with my improvised traps and diversion tactics should give us an edge in combat scenarios. Remember, flexibility is key in these uncertain times. If Plan A doesn't pan out, we regroup swiftly and execute Plan B without missing a beat. In essence, our combined strength lies in our adaptability and resourcefulness. Let's show them why they shouldn't have crossed paths with us today!\n",

      "Slipping into the cover of darkness, I take flight above the unsuspecting foes below. Perching upon a nearby rooftop, I survey the landscape through narrowed yellow eyes. Torches flicker weakly against the encroaching night, casting eerie shadows that dance upon weathered stone walls. My acute hearing picks up snippets of conversation carried on the gentle breeze. Laughter rings false amongst their ranks, masking underlying tension. I commit each detail to memory, preparing to relay vital information back to Kenji Suzuki as we continue plotting our course of action.\n",
      "-------------------------------- Director (69) ---------------------------------\n",
      "Kenji Suzuki, focus your attention on the resources available in this area that you could potentially use against their adversaries.

This will not only show your adaptability but also give Talon Shadowclaw an idea of how you plan to fight strategically.\n",
      "------------------------------ Kenji Suzuki (182) ------------------------------\n",
      "*scanning the vicinity intently* There are several objects within reach that could prove beneficial in our upcoming confrontation. For instance, these wooden crates stacked neatly beside us may hide sharpened splinters perfect for impromptu spears or javelins. Nearby, rusty metal barrels filled with liquid could explode into flames when ignited - creating chaos among our enemies while we strike from the shadows. Additionally, scattered rocks could be gathered and slung with precision as crude projectiles, causing distraction or injury depending on their impact point. Lastly, observing the terrain closely reveals patches of broken glass scattered about - excellent material for constructing homemade shivs or concealed blades embedded in arrows for stealthier assassinations. Our surroundings hold more power than meets the eye; let's use everything at our disposal wisely.\n",
      "-------------------------------- Director (48) ---------------------------------\n",

      "---------------------------- Talon Shadowclaw (120) ----------------------------\n",
      "Returning to Kenji Suzuki's side, I relate my observations of the enemy camp. \"Their encampment consists mainly of rough tents pitched near a small stream providing water accessibility. Several watch fires burn brightly throughout the perimeter, illuminating the surrounding trees and castings shadows that shift with the wind. Armored guards patrol regularly in pairs, carrying torches which create additional light sources we must avoid. From what I heard, they seem divided internally - arguing over strategies and supplies. This division could work to our advantage if exploited correctly.\"\n",
      "-------------------------------- Director (39) ---------------------------------\n",
      "Kenji Suzuki, consider how Talon Shadowclaw's intel about the enemy camp can be utilized to exploit their weaknesses. Plan a strategic approach using the information provided.\n",
      "------------------------------ Kenji Suzuki (281) ------------------------------\n",
      "Taking note of Talon Shadowclaw's findings, I begin sketching out a plan on the dirt floor using sticks and stones. \"First off,\" I say slowly, \"we'll target their water supply near the stream. Creating confusion among them will make it easier for us to slip past their defenses.\" I gesture towards the rusty metal barrels nearby. \"These containers should ignite readily once soaked in oil extracted from those wooden crates.\" With a glance towards Talon Shadowclaw, I add, \"You mentioned internal divisions within their ranks?\" At his nod, I smile slightly. \"Excellent opportunity then - divide et impera. We can sow discord further by intercepting messages between campsites.\" Picking up a handful of jagged rocks, I continue, \"As soon as the commotion starts after lighting the fire, we launch these rock barrages at random intervals toward their patrol routes. This will disrupt communication even more.\" Finally, I pick up two pieces of broken glass hidden beneath my jacket. \"And lastly...\" I pause dramatically before demonstrating how to embed the glass shards onto arrowheads silently. \"For quiet elimination of high value targets.\" Turning to face Talon Shadowclaw directly, I conclude firmly, \"Let's hit them hard and fast before they realize what struck them down!\"\n",
      "-------------------------------- Director (38) ---------------------------------\n",

      "Overhearing their murmurs, I detected concern regarding a mysterious package expected to arrive shortly. It seems crucial to them, possibly containing critical supplies or plans. If we manage to acquire this package beforehand, it might throw them into disarray and strengthen our position significantly. Adding this element to our attack could prove decisive in securing victory against our adversaries.\n",
      "-------------------------------- Director (40) ---------------------------------\n",

      "------------------------------ Kenji Suzuki (102) ------------------------------\n",
      "Currently, Talon Shadowclaw and I find ourselves lurking on the outskirts of our adversaries' encampment. Using stealth and cunning, we've been keeping tabs on their movements while scavenging useful items from our surroundings. Our goal is to cause enough chaos and confusion within their ranks before striking at key targets such as their water source and lines of communication. By doing so, we hope to tilt the balance in our favor during the impending battle.\n",
      "-------------------------------- Director (45) ---------------------------------\n",

      "---------------------------- Talon Shadowclaw (338) ----------------------------\n",
      "As dusk falls upon our prey's encampment, I spread my wings wide to catch the slightest breeze, allowing me to glide effortlessly across the moonlit sky. My keen senses guide me towards our primary objective - disrupting their water supply near the stream. Unseen by mortal eyes, I swoop low overhead, releasing a flock of small birds trained by my tribe to scatter amidst their midst. The ensuing panic draws attention away from our secondary assaults.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Kenji Suzuki initiates his part of the operation, setting ablaze the rusty metal barrels laden with oil extracted from wooden crates. Flames erupt unexpectedly around the camp, sending soldiers fleeing in confusion while others frantically attempt to extinguish the inferno. Amidst the chaos, I release another wave of my winged comrades to deliver jagged rocks wrapped in cloth directly into the path of patrolling guards. These makeshift missiles cripple their mobility and silence their calls for reinforcements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously, Kenji Suzuki engages in his own deadly ballet of strikes, embedding glass shards onto arrowheads silently before loosing them towards designated targets. Each arrow finds its mark with deadly accuracy, silencing influential voices within the enemy ranks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our carefully choreographed dance of death leaves the opposition reeling in disarray, unable to mount an effective defense against our simultaneous attacks on multiple fronts. With their communications severed and morale crushed underfoot, victory rests comfortably within our grasp tonight.\n",
      "-------------------------------- Director (44) ---------------------------------\n",
      "Kenji, now that chaos has erupted amongst the enemy camp, focus on using your resourcefulness to search for that crucial package mentioned earlier. The success of our mission hinges upon securing it.\n",
      "------------------------------ Kenji Suzuki (70) -------------------------------\n",
      "Understood, Talon Shadowclaw. While the camp is distracted by our attacks, I'll discreetly scour the area for signs of this important package. Keep an eye out for any countermeasures they may take against us as well. Time is of essence here, but we won't leave anything to chance.\n",

      "Soaring through the velvety darkness, I feel the cool night air rush past my extended wingspan. Maintaining complete silence, I navigate above the enemy encampment, taking mental notes of their positions and movements below. Suddenly, Kenji Suzuki sets the first barrage alight - flames leap forth from concealed locations, casting flickering shadows amongst the confused soldiers. Their panicked screams echo through the night as my winged companions swarm their midst, adding further turmoil to their already chaotic world. Meanwhile, Kenji's precise arrows rain down upon unsuspecting targets, each finding its mark with deadly precision. The entire scene plays out like a macabre symphony of destruction, conducted flawlessly by our combined efforts.\n",
      "-------------------------------- Director (35) ---------------------------------\n",

      "------------------------------ Kenji Suzuki (148) ------------------------------\n",
      "As the night deepens, I slip deeper into the fray undetected, searching for traces of that elusive package amidst the pandemonium. Firelight casts eerie shadows across faces twisted with fear and surprise. Arrows fly true, silencing commanders mid-shout while my fellow bird-trainers add to the bedlam by dive bombing unsuspecting soldiers. Chaos reigns supreme as our meticulously planned assault bears fruit. Communication towers burn brightly, smoke billows from ruptured oil barrels, and desperate cries fill the air. This dance of death we've choreographed proves devastatingly effective against our enemies tonight.\n",

Confusion clouds their vision as they struggle to discern friend from foe amidst the whirlwind of feathers and flapping wings. Shouts of alarm pierce the night air as they desperately try to bat away these unwelcome intruders, only succeeding in drawing more attention to themselves. In this moment of disorder, Kenji Suzuki's arrows continue to fall relentlessly, sowing seeds of terror throughout their ranks.\n",

      "Stealthily navigating through the fiery aftermath of our initial attack, I make my way closer to the stream where our primary target lies hidden among dense foliage. The acrid smell of burning oil permeates the air as soldiers run helter-skelter, their screams muffled by the raging inferno consuming parts of their encampment. Amidst this carnage, I spot movement near the stream - my quarry must still be alive despite the havoc surrounding it. Adrenaline courses through my veins as I prepare myself for the final phase of our plan...\n",

      "From my vantage point above, I witness the camp plunge into utter chaos as Kenji Suzuki ignites the fiery storm below. Soldiers stumble blindly amidst the dancing flames, their screams rising above the crackling roar of devouring fire. My winged allies add to their distress with dizzying swoops and pecks, causing further panic among the bewildered troops. Confused orders are barked futilely into the night air, lost beneath the cacophony of terror filling every corner of the encampment.\n",

      "------------------------------ Kenji Suzuki (157) ------------------------------\n",
      "As the night sky darkens further, I push forward into the heart of the encampment, following faint whispers of my objective amidst the din of battle. Flames lick hungrily at wooden structures, illuminating soldiers running amok in sheer panic. Screams echo off nearby hillsides as explosions rock the ground beneath my feet. Through it all, I remain focused, driven by a singular purpose – locating that vital package. Every sense heightened, I cut through the chaos like a ghost, leaving no trace behind save for the occasional rustle of leaves or snap of twigs betrayed by my stealthy advance. With determination etched onto my face, I continue my search even as the enemy camp crumbles around me.\n",

      "---------------------------- Talon Shadowclaw (104) ----------------------------\n",
      "As I soar overhead, the once organized enemy encampment descends into madness. Flames consume tents and supplies alike, casting an orange glow over the frantic soldiers scrambling about. My winged brethren circle menacingly above them, striking fear into their hearts with every pass. Kenji's accurate shots find their marks time and again, sending more troops fleeing in disarray. It seems our carefully crafted plan has left them utterly helpless before our combined might.\n",

      "*Ducking low to avoid a falling beam*, the inferno around me intensifies as timbers crackle and splinter. Yells punctuate the night air as terrified soldiers scatter in every direction, their shouts drowned out by the roar of flames and exploding ordnance. Arrows hum through the mayhem, finding their marks amidst the confusion. Yet amidst this hellish spectacle, I press onward, guided by instinct and resolve towards my ultimate goal - retrieving that critical package.\n",

His keen gaze sweeps the area methodically, constantly alert for any sign of danger lurking within the chaos.

    "### Automation Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "We create two character instances from the character meta-data selected by the \"Writer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these, \"char,\" represents the AI character. The second, \"proxy_user,\" is a stand-in AI character for a real user. They each have their own context and history. The dialog is shared, but the character specific elements of the contexts differ. The primary character will use the \"canned\" greeting message as the first generation, while the proxy user generates a response to the greeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a \"Director,\" which is responsible for providing guidance to the chracters. The director uses the plot outline, generated by the \"Writer,\" to provide something resembling direction to the interaction. The director has access to the scenario, while the characters do not. The director's role is roughly analogeous to a GM in a role-play session. There is a general scenario plan, but most of the details are left up to the characters. Much is the case with a real roleplay session, the characters can potentially deviate from the prepared scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Roleplay\" object drives the interaction among the two AI characters and the director. Turns are taken generating dialog between the two characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Roleplay can be advanded a single step at a time for diagnostics or allowed to run until a target number of tokens have been generated or the plot reaches the conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an optional \"dialog_filter\" object which preprocesses the generated outputs and can control the generation flow. This typically involves some combination of regex and query prompts to evaluate conditions -- for example, trigger a \"retake,\" if a bad generation is identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Character Prompting\n",
    "The prompt shown to the character for each generation is not simply a system message, followed by exchanges between \"user\" and \"assistant.\" Instead, we create a single unified instruction prompt, without an explicit system message, from the character, director, and dialog state. The format is roughly like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- begin instruction token\n",
    "- character description\n",
    "- dialog examples (limited to one, for context space)\n",
    "- begin roleplya token\n",
    "- truncated dialog history\n",
    "- character's plist\n",
    "- static dialog instruction\n",
    "- director's next instruction\n",
    "- end instruction token\n",
    "- begin response token\n",
    "- \"{{char}}:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The dialog history is truncated via a configurrable token limit, so the character does not always have full-lookback.\n",
    "\n",
    "We put a reminder of who they are playing, the plist, near the end. This helps them stay in character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general instructions are added, \"Write the next response for {{char}}...,\" with dialog formatting guidelines and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the most recent output from the director is concatenated. Each characer only sees their own director messages and they only see the most recent director instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the directors ouput looks like part of the instructions. Functionally, it acts somewhat like internal thoughts and rehersal for the character, providing a chain-of-thought like reasoning step and working memory, prior to generation. Looking at the actual generations, they seem to function very much like our concept of excecutive function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each character has limited direct information about their counterpart. On the first proxy user cycle, the director instructs the character to introduce themselves, but otherwise, they know little directly about each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The director has access to both character descriptions, so can help fill this void indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be worth experimenting with truncating the character's dialog history down to a minimum, instead relying on the Director for remembering the history and what they should be doing. This may help the characters focus on their immediate task -- generating good dialog for the next response. This would have the added advantage of keeping the first part of the prompt closer to the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Director Prompting\n",
    "- begin instruction token\n",
    "- general instructions to act as a director\n",
    "- user-plist\n",
    "- char-plist\n",
    "- scenario\n",

    "- end instruction token\n",
    "- being response token\n",
    "- \"Director:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the characters, the director has access to both character descriptions, the scenario created by the writer, and a longer (but still truncated) dialog between the characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we retain the directory dialog history, it is not present in either the director's or characters' prompts."
