    "### Automation Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "We create two character instances from the character meta-data selected by the \"Writer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these, \"char,\" represents the AI character. The second, \"proxy_user,\" is a stand-in AI character for a real user. They each have their own context and history. The dialog is shared, but the character specific elements of the contexts differ. The primary character will use the \"canned\" greeting message as the first generation, while the proxy user generates a response to the greeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a \"Director,\" which is responsible for providing guidance to the chracters. The director uses the plot outline, generated by the \"Writer,\" to provide something resembling direction to the interaction. The director has access to the scenario, while the characters do not. The director's role is roughly analogeous to a GM in a role-play session. There is a general scenario plan, but most of the details are left up to the characters. Much is the case with a real roleplay session, the characters can potentially deviate from the prepared scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Roleplay\" object drives the interaction among the two AI characters and the director. Turns are taken generating dialog between the two characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Roleplay can be advanded a single step at a time for diagnostics or allowed to run until a target number of tokens have been generated or the plot reaches the conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an optional \"dialog_filter\" object which preprocesses the generated outputs and can control the generation flow. This typically involves some combination of regex and query prompts to evaluate conditions -- for example, trigger a \"retake,\" if a bad generation is identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Character Prompting\n",
    "The prompt shown to the character for each generation is not simply a system message, followed by exchanges between \"user\" and \"assistant.\" Instead, we create a single unified instruction prompt, without an explicit system message, from the character, director, and dialog state. The format is roughly like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- begin instruction token\n",
    "- character description\n",
    "- dialog examples (limited to one, for context space)\n",
    "- begin roleplya token\n",
    "- truncated dialog history\n",
    "- character's plist\n",
    "- static dialog instruction\n",
    "- director's next instruction\n",
    "- end instruction token\n",
    "- begin response token\n",
    "- \"{{char}}:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The dialog history is truncated via a configurrable token limit, so the character does not always have full-lookback.\n",
    "\n",
    "We put a reminder of who they are playing, the plist, near the end. This helps them stay in character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general instructions are added, \"Write the next response for {{char}}...,\" with dialog formatting guidelines and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the most recent output from the director is concatenated. Each characer only sees their own director messages and they only see the most recent director instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the directors ouput looks like part of the instructions. Functionally, it acts somewhat like internal thoughts and rehersal for the character, providing a chain-of-thought like reasoning step and working memory, prior to generation. Looking at the actual generations, they seem to function very much like our concept of excecutive function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each character has limited direct information about their counterpart. On the first proxy user cycle, the director instructs the character to introduce themselves, but otherwise, they know little directly about each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The director has access to both character descriptions, so can help fill this void indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be worth experimenting with truncating the character's dialog history down to a minimum, instead relying on the Director for remembering the history and what they should be doing. This may help the characters focus on their immediate task -- generating good dialog for the next response. This would have the added advantage of keeping the first part of the prompt closer to the next generation.\n",
